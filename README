EDACC Web Frontend - Experiment Design and Administration for Computer Clusters for SAT Solvers

See http://sourceforge.net/projects/edacc/ for the EDACC project.

~ Dependencies:
Python 2.6.5 http://www.python.org
SQLAlchemy 0.6.1 (SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper)
mysql-python 1.2.3c1 (Python MySQL adapter)
Flask 0.3.1 (Micro Webframework)
Werkzeug 0.6.2 (Webframework, Flask dependency)
Jinja2 2.4 (Template Engine)
rpy2 2.1.3 (Python R interface)
R 2.11 (language for statistical computing and graphics)

optional:
python-memcached v1.45 + memcached 1.4.5 (enable/disable in config.py)

~ Installation:
The required libraries can most likely be installed using the
package management tool of your favorite Linux distribution.
However, they are also available in the Python Package Index PyPi http://pypi.python.org/pypi
and can be installed using easy_install or pip (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)

It is recommended not to install these libraries system-wide but in a virtual
python environment to prevent any conflicts and ensure that the correct versions are
available for the web frontend.

To get rpy2 working the GNU linker (ld) has to be able to find libR.so. Add the folder containing
libR.so (usually /usr/lib/R/lib) to the ld config: Create a file called R.conf containing the
path in the folder /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ and run ldconfig as root.

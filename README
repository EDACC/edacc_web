EDACC Web Frontend - Experiment Design and Administration for Computer Clusters for SAT Solvers

See http://sourceforge.net/projects/edacc/ for the EDACC project.

Dependencies:
Python 2.6.5 http://www.python.org
SQLAlchemy 0.6.1 (SQL Toolkit and Object Relational Mapper)
mysql-python 1.2.3c1 (Python MySQL adapter)
Flask 0.3.1 (Micro Webframework)

optional:

Installation:
The required libraries can most likely be installed using the
package management tool of your favorite Linux distribution.
However, they are also available in the Python Package Index PyPi http://pypi.python.org/pypi
and can be installed using easy_install, a Python package manager that comes
with setuptools (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)

It is recommended not to install these libraries system-wide but in a virtual
python environment to prevent any conflicts and ensure that the correct versions are
available for the web frontend.
